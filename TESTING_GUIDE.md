## 🔧 **Advanced Integration Tests**

### Multi-Step Tasks:
```
1. "system info" → check response time
2. "open notepad" → verify it opens
3. "volume up" → verify volume increases
4. "add task Test the assistant" → verify task added
5. "remember testing is complete" → verify memory saved
6. "show tasks" → verify task appears
7. "performance" → check system stats
8. "kill notepad" → verify notepad closes
```

### Stress Tests:
```
1. Run same command 10 times rapidly
2. Test caching by running "system info" multiple times
3. Open and close multiple apps quickly
4. Add many tasks and memories
```

---

## 🚨 **Error Handling Tests**

- **App Launch**: 10-50ms
- **File Operations**: <50ms
- **AI Response**: 1-5 seconds (depends on complexity)

### Commands for Performance Testing:
```
system info (should be fast due to caching)
performance (should be fast due to caching)
volume up (should be instant)
open calculator (should be very fast)
```

---

## 🎭 **Fun Demo Commands**

### Show-off Commands:
```
"Lock my computer"
"Turn up the volume"
"What's my system performance?"
"Open notepad and then kill it"

## 🐛 **Known Limitations to Test**

1. **Internet-dependent features** won't work (by design)
2. **Vision system** needs camera access
3. **PowerShell commands** may need admin rights
4. **Network controls** depend on adapter names
5. **Brightness control** may not work on all displays

---

## 🏁 **Quick Start Test Sequence**

Run these commands in order for a complete test:

```
1. system info
2. performance  
3. volume up
4. open notepad
5. add task Test my assistant
6. remember this is my first test
7. show tasks
8. kill notepad
9. What is artificial intelligence?
10. show memories
```

**Expected total time**: <30 seconds for all commands

---

## 💡 **Pro Testing Tips**

1. **Test response times** - Commands should be snappy
2. **Check error handling** - Try invalid commands
3. **Verify caching** - Run "system info" twice quickly
4. **Test voice mode** - Switch to voice input
5. **Monitor resource usage** - Check if assistant is lightweight
6. **Test database persistence** - Restart and check if tasks/memories persist
