## üéØ **COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM CONTROL CAPABILITIES**

Your offline assistant has **full laptop control** with these categories:

---

## üîä **AUDIO & SOUND CONTROL**
**‚ö° Response Time: 0-10ms (Instant)**

### Volume Control Commands:
```
volume up                    # Increase volume by 10%
volume down                  # Decrease volume by 10% 
mute                        # Toggle mute/unmute
volume max                  # Set volume to 100%
volume zero                 # Set volume to 0%
set volume to 50            # Set specific volume level
```

**How it works:** Direct Windows API calls (keybd_event) - instant hardware response

---

## üñ•Ô∏è **DISPLAY & BRIGHTNESS CONTROL**
**‚ö° Response Time: 50-200ms**

### Screen Control Commands:
```
brightness up               # Increase screen brightness
brightness down             # Decrease screen brightness
screen brighter            # Make screen brighter
display dimmer             # Make display dimmer
brightness max             # Maximum brightness
brightness min             # Minimum brightness
set brightness to 80       # Set specific brightness level
```

**How it works:** WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) calls to hardware

## ‚ö° **POWER MANAGEMENT**
**‚ö° Response Time: 0-50ms**

### Power Control Commands:
```
lock screen                 # Lock workstation instantly
lock                       # Lock computer
sleep                      # Put system to sleep
hibernate                  # Hibernate system
shutdown                   # Shutdown with 30s countdown
restart                    # Restart with 30s countdown
power off                  # Shutdown computer
reboot                     # Restart computer
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: These commands actually execute system power operations!**

**How it works:** 
- Lock: Direct Windows API (LockWorkStation)
- Sleep/Hibernate: PowerShell power management
- Shutdown/Restart: Windows shutdown command

## üöÄ **APPLICATION MANAGEMENT**
**‚ö° Response Time: 10-50ms**

### Launch Applications:
```
open notepad               # Launch Windows Notepad
launch calculator          # Open Calculator app
start paint               # Launch MS Paint
open chrome               # Launch Google Chrome
open firefox              # Launch Firefox browser
launch explorer           # Open File Explorer
open cmd                  # Launch Command Prompt
start powershell          # Open PowerShell
```

### Close Applications:
```
kill notepad              # Terminate Notepad process
close calculator          # Close Calculator
terminate chrome          # Kill Chrome process
kill firefox              # Terminate Firefox
close paint               # Close MS Paint
```

**How it works:** 
- Launch: subprocess.Popen() with shell execution
- Kill: taskkill command with process name matching

---

## üåê **NETWORK CONTROL**
**‚ö° Response Time: 100-500ms**

### Network Commands:
```
wifi on                   # Enable WiFi adapter
wifi off                  # Disable WiFi adapter
network status            # Check network connection
wireless enable           # Enable wireless adapter
wireless disable          # Disable wireless adapter
```

**How it works:** netsh interface commands for adapter control

---

## üìÅ **FILE SYSTEM OPERATIONS**
**‚ö° Response Time: 10-100ms**

### File Management:
```
create file test.txt      # Create new file
delete file test.txt      # Delete existing file
make file example.log     # Create file with name
remove file old.txt       # Remove file
```

**How it works:** 
- Create: Python Path.touch() or open() file creation
- Delete: os.remove() system calls

---

## üìä **SYSTEM MONITORING & INFORMATION**
**‚ö° Response Time: 25-150ms (Cached)**

### System Information:
```
system info               # Host, OS, CPU count
computer info             # Hardware information  
pc info                   # System specifications
hardware info             # Computer hardware details
system status             # Current system state
```

### Performance Monitoring:
```
performance               # CPU, RAM, Disk usage
cpu usage                 # Current CPU utilization
memory usage              # RAM usage statistics
disk usage                # Storage space info
```

**Sample Output:**
```
System: Host: ABHIRAM | OS: Windows | CPUs: 20
Performance: CPU: 12.7% | RAM: 58.7% | Disk: 4.6%
```

**How it works:**
